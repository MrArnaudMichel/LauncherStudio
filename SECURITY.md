# Security Policy

We take the security of Launcher Studio and its users seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please follow the guidelines below.

## Supported Versions
While this project is under active development (pre-1.0), we generally support the latest release. Security fixes will be prioritized on the default branch and included in the next release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Do not open a public issue for security reports.
- Email your report to: contact@arnaudmichel.fr
- Include a detailed description of the issue, steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any suggested mitigation.
- If you have a working proof-of-concept, please include it. Limit any impact on third parties when demonstrating the issue.

We will acknowledge receipt within 5 business days and aim to provide a timeline for remediation after initial assessment. You will be notified when the fix is available. If appropriate, we will credit you in the release notes.

## Coordinated Disclosure
We prefer coordinated disclosure. Please allow us reasonable time to investigate and release a fix before any public disclosure. We may request additional time depending on complexity and potential impact.

## Scope
This policy covers the Launcher Studio source code and published binaries within this repository. Third-party dependencies are out of scope, though we appreciate reports with details suitable for forwarding upstream.

## Encryption Key (Optional)
If you prefer to encrypt your report, please ask for a PGP key in your initial email, and we will provide one.
