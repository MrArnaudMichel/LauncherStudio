## Build, Package, and Publish

Once your changes are ready, you can build and publish a version of your app for others to use.

### 1. Generate the Package and APT Repository

```

This script will:
- Compile the app in `release` mode.

```shell
bash ./publish_to_gh_pages.sh
```


The script will:
- Upload the contents of the `debian/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.
- Update the remote repository with your APT repository.

### 3. Configure GitHub Pages

In your repository settings:
- Set GitHub Pages to use the `gh-pages` branch.
- Choose the root directory as the publishing source.

### 4. User Updates
